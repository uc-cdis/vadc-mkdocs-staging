GWAS App provides over 500 variables for your selection (for example, height, weight, blood pressure, white blood cell, and other clinical observations). Please select the outcome phenotype you wish to use in your model. All data are harmonized from different projects through the collaborative development of a data dictionary. To browse the table, please scroll down to the bottom. To search the table, please enter free text in the search box to search by phenotype name. In the plot near the table, you can learn more about the selected outcome distribution in the study population. After you select your outcome, click \u201cSubmit\u201d to apply it for your model. After clicking \"Submit\", you will see the selection in your attrition table.</p> <p>Dichotomous Outcome</p> <p>Here, you may choose your dichotomous outcome phenotype.
